# SDL 2 DOOM

<p align="center"><b>DISCLAIMER:<br></b> This repository is <b>NOT</b> meant to be used as a replacement for any modern source port. It has issues and is <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>. Please look into one of the more popular source ports if that is your goal. The main goal of this repository is my exploration into the doom source code. <br>
 
Hopefully I will eventually have time to return to this project.

## Overview

This is a source port of the linuxdoom 1.10 engine, developed mostly as an educational tool for myself. Anyone 
interested in hacking on this project is more than welcome to submit a pull request. This project is currently
in very early development. See the todo file in /docs/ to see the list of additions I would like to make to
this engine.
 
## Future

I hope to work on this project again soon. Hopefully a windows port will follow. Please feel free to hack on this codebase and submit any issues or pull requests.
